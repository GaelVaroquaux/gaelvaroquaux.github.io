<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-1">Beyond maths: Unpacking the scale narrative in AI</a></h2>
<p>Plotting the increase of the scale of notable AI systems in the last
years reveals a staggering explosion. AI’s size has been growing super
exponentially on a variety of dimensions: training compute, training cost
(figure below), inference cost, amount of data used. Studying the wording
used in pivotal publications as well as company communications shows that
it anchors AI success in this growth, thus <strong>settings implicit social
norms around scale</strong>. But systematic analysis of benchmark results show
that <strong>scale does not always bring benefit</strong>. The narrative of scale is
simplified and leaves aside many important ingredients of success of AI
systems. In addition, the race for scale comes with planetary and
societal consequences, which we study and <a class="reference external" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3715275.3732006">document</a>. Ever-increasing
inference costs threaten economic and electricity sustainability. An
unstoppable appetite for training data leads to fitting models on
enormous datasets that elude quality control, engulfing undesirable
facets of internet (including child pornography) or eroding privacy. The
race for scale has financial consequences, benefiting above all actors of
compute, but also structuring an ecosystem where cash-rich and GPU-rich
actors have leverage on priorities, industrial or academic. These actors
sometimes have circular investments strategies: funding third parties
that will spend all this funding in compute, which can fuel <strong>an
investment bubble in AI</strong>.</p>

<p>We conclude our study, <a class="reference external" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3715275.3732006">published at FAccT</a>, by underlining that <strong>academic
research has a central role to play in these dynamics and must shape a
healthy and grounded narrative</strong>. We recommend to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>pursue basic AI research of interest independent of scale, <em>eg</em>
uncertainty quantification, causality…</li>
<li>hold responsible norms, in particular avoiding asking for compute
increase when editing or reviewing,</li>
<li>always publish measures of compute to document the tradeoffs.</li>
</ol>

<img alt="" src="attachments/2025_highlights/pareto_schema.png" style="width: 400px;" />
<p class="caption">We need to document and explore the tradeoffs</p>
</div>
<p>In addition, I personally want to push those tradeoffs in the direction
of resource efficient progress, and not only resource intensive progress
(as illustrated on the figure alongside),
which is the easy route to task performance, but not the one that brings
most value.</p>

<div class="section" id="tabicl-open-source-table-foundation-model">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-3">TabICL:  open-source table foundation model</a></h3>
<p>Recent tabular-learning models have been bringing better performance. A
poster example is that of the TabPFN series of models, that rely on
pretrained transformers to bring excellent performance. However, the
quadratic complexity of the transformers is a bottleneck. I do fear that
the agenda of fancy tabular learning is leading us into a race for scale
again.</p>
<p>With the <a class="reference external" href="https://icml.cc/virtual/2025/poster/46681">TabICL model</a> we
strives to decrease this computational cost. We showed that a multi-stage
architecture can build a pre-trained in-context predictor where the
separation of states decreases the quadratic cost. The model can be
pretrained on larger datasets, and thus results in the best performer in
settings of larger tables. The model is faster than alternatives, in
particular when using a CPU rather than a GPU. In addition, we released
in <strong>open source all the code</strong>, including the pretraining.</p>
<p>TabICL gives a table foundation model that is easy to use on modest or
big hardware and that can be easily customized.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-4">Retrieve merge predict: tradeoffs of predictions from data lakes</a></h3>
<p>A full data-science pipeline must often assemble data across multiple
source tables:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Alice is working on a base table that contains information about
movies. She has also access to a data lake, or a collection of other
tables on all sorts of subjects. She wants to predict the ranking of
a movie based on as much information as possible. She would like to
extract information from the data lake to the performance of her
model.</em></p>
<p><em>The challenge is that the information of interest is mixed with a
huge amount of unrelated data. Thus, Alice’s problem is: “how to find
tables that are relevant to my problem? how to combine them with the
base table?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the user is faced with a complex data lake, many
tables and little explicit link between them, it is difficult to find the
best assembly for a given machine-learning task. This problem requires
not only finding which table must be joined in the main table of interest
–a table retrieval problem–, but also how to aggregate multiple records
when tables are linked through a many-to-one relation. While table
retrieval is a classic problem of the data management literature, it had
been understudied in the case of supervised machine learning. We
assembled a systematic –and open– benchmark with data lakes emph{and}
supervised-learning tasks (<a class="reference external" href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=4uPJN6yfY1">publication</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://soda-inria.github.io/retrieve-merge-predict/">benchmark material</a> ).</p>
<p>We found that supervised learning does change the picture compared to
classic table-retrieval settings in that for a fixed compute budget, it
is worth avoiding fancy retrieval methods, which can be very
computationally costly, and rather using better supervised learning
methods, which can be comparatively less expensive while being
able to extract the relevant information from a noisy retrieval.</p>

<p class="caption">A schema of the pipeline</p>
</div>
<p>The pipeline that we studied here is one that is broader than the
typical machine-learning modeling step. In my experience, data-science
applications are often much more complex than mere tabular learning, and
for these reason, we develop the skrub software, described below.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://skrub-data.org">Skrub</a> is a recent library to blend machine
learning with data-frame computing. In 2025, we have ironed existing
features to make them more performant and really easy to use. For
instance the <a class="reference external" href="https://skrub-data.org/stable/reference/generated/skrub.TableVectorizer.html">TableVectorizer</a>
is incredibly useful to build tabular machine-learning pipelines. But we
have also added exciting new features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="https://skrub-data.org/stable/reference/generated/skrub.ApplyToCols.html">ApplyToCols</a> is an object that can use skrub’s powerful <a class="reference external" href="https://skrub-data.org/stable/modules/multi_column_operations/selectors.html">selectors</a> to apply transforms to some columns but not others. I find myself using it all the time.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://skrub-data.org/stable/data_ops.html">DataOps</a> are an
incredibly powerful way of blending dataframe transformation and
scikit-learn fit/transform/predict API, to build complete machine
learning pipeline across multiple tables. The benefit is that, unlike
standard data wrangling code, they can be applied to new data,
cross-validated, or any component of the pipeline can be tuned to
maximize a prediction score. We even have added optuna support for this
tuning.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fundamental-progress-in-scikit-learn">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-7">Fundamental progress in scikit-learn</a></h3>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://scikit-learn.org"><img alt="" class="align-right" src="attachments/scikit-learn-logo.png" style="width: 150px;" /></a>
<p>What strikes me in the 2025 releases of <a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-learn.org">scikit-learn</a> is that we have been
making progress on fundamental improvements to the core features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Faster linear models and tree based model due to better algorithms
(which, in certain cases give massive speedups).</li>
<li>Ramping up GPU support: we are progressively adding to scikit-learn a
compute backend that enable GPU computing (an intro <a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/release_highlights/plot_release_highlights_1_8_0.html#array-api-support-enables-gpu-computations">here</a>)</li>
<li>Free-threaded: we now support the “free-threaded” version of Python,
which removes a central lock and opens the door to
heavily-multithreaded parallel computing. More of the ecosystem needs
to support Python free-threaded for it to be widely used, but I am
hoping that in the mid-term we’ll see great improvements to parallel
computing.</li>
