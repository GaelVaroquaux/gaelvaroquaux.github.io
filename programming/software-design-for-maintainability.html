Such unpleasant experiences are all too frequent, and weight a lot on my view of code design.</p><div class=section id=my-stance-on-code-design><h2>My stance on code design</h2><img alt class=align-right src=../programming/attachments/software_design_for_maintainability/cool-car-drawing-5.jpg style="width: 30%;"><p>I call <em>code design</em> the process of designing the architecture of a piece of software: what are the objects it uses? how do they interact? how is the information passed around?…</p><p>My view of code design and software engineering has progressively evolved to favor <strong>extreme simplicity</strong> over sophistication. I believe that a good programmer should know <a class="reference external" href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_%28computer_science%29>design patterns</a>, <a class="reference external" href=http://gael-varoquaux.info/computers/python_advanced/index.html>powerful language features</a>, <a class="reference external" href=http://scipy2010.blogspot.com/2010/06/tutorials-day-1-advanced-numpy.html>libraries dark corners</a>, and <em>not use them unless absolutely necessary</em>.</p></div><div class=section id=some-rules-of-thumb><h2>Some rules of thumb</h2><p>Here are some rules that I apply nowadays when writing code that I would like to last (I am aware that some of them go against well-advertised best practices).</p><ul class=simple><li><strong>Keep it as simple a possible, really!</strong> Experimental results have shown that the tractability of a code base goes down as the square of the number of interactions, and thus much quicker than the number of lines in a project. Each time you add a line, think about it: can you make simpler? If not you’ll have to find resources to maintain your project as fixing bugs or adding features will grow harder.</li><li><strong>Design for the 80% usecases.</strong> In the same vein, a small decrease in the requirements can make your project much simpler <a class="reference external" href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F32%2F35909%2F01702600.pdf%3Farnumber%3D1702600&amp;authDecision=-203">[Woodfield1979]</a>. Corner cases and minor usecases should not make the whole project complex and hard to maintain. If you can, give up on what is bringing in complexity. If you cannot, isolate it, and don’t let it sit at the core of your design.</li><li><strong>Don’t design for the future.</strong> Again the same core idea: don’t start planing for all the usecases, and all the difficulties that you haven’t encountered, you will most certainly design wrong, and chances are that you’ll add complexity that you do not use. Design simple, design cleanly and refactor as you go, based on concrete problems. This is known as the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it">“YAGNI principle”</a>.</li></ul><img alt class=align-center src=../programming/attachments/software_design_for_maintainability/howtobuildmvp.gif style="width: 60%;"><ul class=simple><li><strong>Don’t be clever.</strong> Each time you do a clever trick, whoever has to read and maintain this code will have to understand it (that person may be you, in a few years). Chances are that they’ll get it wrong and start by loosing a lot of time.</li><li><strong>Repeating yourself may actually be OK.</strong> This is a case of <em>practicality beats purity</em>. Repeating code is really a bad thing in software design, because it leads to an increased number of lines to debug, and tends to hinder reusability. However, adding complexity in order to save a few lines of duplicated code will cost you more in the long run.</li><li><strong>Use objects sparingly.</strong> Object are great, but are they always need? An object with a single method <em>eval</em> can probably simply be implemented by a function. The limitation of objects is that they all have a different behavior. As a result, the users and maintainers of your codebase will first have to understand how all your classes interact before understanding your code. This also means that there is a lot of benefit in making many different classes that have the same interface.</li><li><strong>Avoid abstractions and levels of indirection.</strong> The more levels of code piled on top one of the other, the more layers your maintainer is going to have to inspect to find were the bug might be. An abstraction hides another object or algorithm. To debug code, chances are that all the black boxes will first have to be opened.</li></ul></div><div class=section id=coding-for-others-to-debug><h2>Coding for others to debug</h2><blockquote class=epigraph> “Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
