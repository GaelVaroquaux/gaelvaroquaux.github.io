Our day to day work is to write machine-learning and statistics code to understand and use better images of brain function (most often fMRI). Our purpose is to be useful to the NeuroImaging community, mostly medical and cognitive science researched, to understand brain function better. What is limiting us in this respect is that to reach end users we need to turn our algorithms in usable software.</p><p>This is why Parietal has a long tradition of investing in building an ecosystem of <a class="reference external" href=https://team.inria.fr/parietal/software>high-quality libraries and tools</a>: we build, layer by layer, an environment in which we can do our research, and with which we hope to one day reach the user. We choose Python, as a high-level general purpose language with which we can do scientific computing, and, one day, GUIs, or web servers. We contribute to the scipy ecosystem; we have built the foundations of the most successful Python machine learning library, <a class="reference external" href=http://scikit-learn>scikit-learn</a>. We are invested in the <a class="reference external" href=http://nipy.org>neuroimaging in Python ecosystem</a>. Our students, our team members, send patches to scientific Python projects, teach courses on how to use them, speak at conferences.</p><p>But to go all the way, we need support from people who do software as there sole goal. To put the finishing touch on the quality of our end-user libraries, we need full-time programmers. In an academic setting, they can be hard to justify, but we have always had dedicate top-notch engineers at Parietal, our latest hire being the well-known <a class="reference external" href=http://ogrisel.com/>Olivier Grisel</a>. This is where <strong>you</strong> can come in.</p><p>The <a class="reference external" href=https://team.inria.fr/parietal/research/spatial_patterns/niconnect/>NiConnect</a> is a specific research project in which we are developing leading algorithmic tools. For this project, we have funding for a full-time programmer. Someone that will help us make from our understand of how to process brain images, a software tool that an cognitive science researcher can use. We have started work on such a software, in the <a class="reference external" href=http://nilearn.github.io/>nilearn</a> project. What we need is someone who drives the project, and makes sure that the piece fit in together well. That the code to solve the user’s problem is not our research code, but a clean and lean library, just like scikit-learn is an elegant answer to day-to-day machine learning tasks.</p><p>If you want more details, they can be found on the <a class="reference external" href=https://team.inria.fr/parietal/job-offers>job offer</a>.

To be clear, the kind of person I am looking for has no difficulties finding a well-payed job elsewhere. So, if you are that person, why would you take the job.</p><ul class=simple><li>To join <a class="reference external" href=https://team.inria.fr/parietal/team-members/>a great team</a> that is focused on finding elegant solutions to hard problems at the intersection of machine learning, cognitive science, and software. Choose to work with great people, knowledgeable, passionate, and <a class="reference external" href=https://team.inria.fr/parietal/inria-winter-party-2014/>fun</a>.</li><li>To work on interesting problems, that matter. They are interesting because they are challenging but we have the skills to solve them. They matter because these skills need to be used to make brain research better.</li><li>To have a boss (<a class="reference external" href=https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux>me</a>) that actually codes and gives you feedback on your code.</li><li>To learn. Data science + Python is <em>the</em> combination of skills to have. We have a at Parietal a unique expertise in these. And add to it fine understanding of algorithms, high performance computing, statistics, and software quality.
