This is why I have been really bad at dealing with questions on the mailing-lists, bug-reports or feature requests.</p><div class=section id=before><h2>Before</h2><p>So far I have been working as a physicist, doing atomic physics (Bose Einstein Condensation). I studied quantum physics, mostly theory, and I did a PhD in an experimental lab, building a couple of experiments on Bose Einstein Condensation and atom interferometry. After this, I moved to Florence to do a post-doc also on a BEC experiment.</p><div class=figure><a class="reference external image-reference" href=attachments/gregor_in_lab.jpg><img alt src=attachments/gregor_in_lab.jpg style="width: 66%;"></a><p class=caption>A colleague working on the experiment in Florence</p></div><p>This kind of work is very experimental. These experiments are monsters that you have to keep alive doing a lot of homemade mechanics, optics, and electronics. I thought I would love that, because I used to like working with my hands, but I grew tired of it. I wanted to work more with abstractions. And in addition I am computer geek, the parts of my job I preferred were related to computers.</p></div><div class=section id=this-summer><h2>This summer</h2><p>My contract has ended at the end of April, and I have not renewed it. I was missing my girlfriend and wanted to come back to Paris. So now I am jobless, living at the expense of my girlfriend. I decided to take some time without a job, as I have the feeling I have been working without stopping for the last few years, not having time to travel and visit the world as I like to. We are planning a three weeks trip to Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan in two weeks.</p><p>After this i am going to devote my summer to hacking. The big news is that I am going to be going to the states. I will spend most of my time in Austin, working for <a class="reference external" href=http://www.enthought.com>Enthought</a>. I am very excited about this, as I see this as the occasion to learn more about building scientific GUIs with Python. Building usable scientific programs is something that I am passionate about. I will also spend some time at Berkeley, with Fernando Perez, hopefully to work on Ipython1. I need to thank Enthought for making this possible for me, as they are providing the money. With some luck, this summer I will be productive on the free software side.</p><p>Of course right now I am battling with moving houses, fighting for visas, trying to fall back on my feet and organize the summer. I still don’t have my visa for the states, and it is making me nervous. I would really hate to have to cancel my trip to Kyrgyzstan because of visa problems with the states: I take time off work, I expect to spend it enjoying myself, and not waiting for visas.</p></div><div class=section id=the-future><h2>The future</h2><p>So I am quitting atomic physics. I am starting a new adventure in something totally new for me. Starting from October, I will be working with JB Poline and Bertrand Thirion, at <a class="reference external" href=http://www-dsv.cea.fr/neurospin/>Neurospin</a>, on neuroimaging. This work is mostly data processing, even though it has a lot of interplay with the physics of NMR. This is something very new for me and I will have to discover a new field. The good news is that a lot of the work is centered on computers, and one of the core technologies used at Neurospin is Python.</p></div><div class=hr style="margin-bottom: -.5em;"></div><span class=social_links><a href=http://twitter.com/share class=twitter-share-button data-count=horizontal data-via=GaelVaroquaux>Tweet</a><script type=text/javascript src=http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js async defer></script><span class=g-plusone data-size=medium></span></span><a href=# class=go-top>Go Top</a><div class=comments><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>
