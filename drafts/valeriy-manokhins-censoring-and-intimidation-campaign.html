<p>I’m publishing details of a fight that I had with Valeriy Manokhin to
shed some light on how he does thing. Intimmidation attempts should not
be successful, and I am publishing this story so that the behavior is
documented. I believe in being positive, stringing for solutions, rather
than digging dirt; this post is unfortunate and I want to focus on other
things.</p>

<div class="section" id="valeriy-a-history-of-bullying-and-one-sided-views-on-data-science">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-1">Valeriy: a history of bullying and one-sided views on data science</a></h2>
<p>Valeriy is a prolific poster on social media. He writes, amongst other
things, about conformal prediction, a topic on which he did his PhD.</p>
<p>I had noticed since a long time that he tends to have a provocative
behavior. He writes statement such as “[major ML library] misleads users”
if the corresponding library does not implement conformal prediction, or
will call research papers by ML major researchers (more than me) “murky”
and “dubious” when they do not match his world view.</p>
<p><strong>Trolling</strong> – We are all human beings, with our biases and
cognitive dissonance, however Valeriy pushes provocation very far and
reaches a large number of followers across various social media
platforms. To this large audience, he serves simplified and misleading
messages that are not helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Bullying</strong> – In addition, he is often dismissive of work that does not
align with his views, calling classic statistical methods or ML software
all sorts of bad words (eg “19th Century” or “surface-level hacks”). He
has been doing this repeatedly over years, targeting particularly the
most popular tools, and thus scikit-learn (in which I am personally
invested). Such attacks are harmful both to the mental well-being of the
people doing the work (often volunteers, or people going the extra mile
beyond their day job to democratize data science) and to the
corresponding projects, which suffer for bad optics. People invest their
energy in data science if it brings positive vibes out, not to see turf
wars bringing being dismissive of standard tools.</p>
<p><strong>An insincere conversation</strong> – Making matters worse, Valeriy
systematically deletes information from Internet. He has a pattern of
posting inflammatory remarks, and coming back later to remove them. As a
result, it is not possible to portray well his behavior or confront.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="my-trigger-a-disrepectful-linkedin-exchange">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-2">My trigger: a disrepectful Linkedin exchange</a></h2>
<p>End of August 2025, Valeriy got annoyed when watching <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI6bde9CKkc">a video of an
invited lecture</a> that I
had given at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Science in
Cambridge. My presentation was on uncertainty quantification, but I
quickly brushed away conformal prediction <a class="footnote-reference" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>, which wasn’t my topic.</p>
<table class="side-hanging docutils footnote" frame="void" id="footnote-1" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#footnote-reference-1">[1]</a></td><td>Looking at the video, I specifically said “in my experience, a lot
of the tools don’t work, or they work in theory but I don’t know how
to use them. One example is conformal prediction. I mean, there is
some conformal prediction on classifiers, I’ve just never been able to
do anything meaningful with it. The idea of coverage set when you have
two outcomes, I just can’t do something useful with it.” I said this
because we had tried to start from conformal theory for the work that
I was presenting, but failed. I was not reading from a text with
controled words, just giving an hour-long lecture.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Valeriy wrote a inflammatory LinkedIn post lashing at scikit-learn
(though my lecture and my work was completely independent of
scikit-learn) as such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Scikit-learn has become an antique museum piece in machine learning. It
is still paraded around as if it were modern, but in reality it lags far
behind. […]</em></p>
<p><em>When confronted with conformal prediction, a scikit-learn representative
dismissed it as useless because of sets. That statement says everything:
it’s not conformal prediction that fails, it’s scikit-learn’s inability
to move beyond toy-level tutorials.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He did not link to the video, not did he ever name me or was explicit
about what he was referring to. But shared a screenshot of the moment at
which I said the above.</p>
<p>His post also referred Venn-Abers conformalization of classifiers as a
solution to working beyond solely two outcomes, in classification
settings</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>I was pointed to his post, and added a comment pointing out that most
conformal prediction work, an in particular the Venn Abers, had
<em>marginal</em> control, while for decision making, as in my talk, we needed
<em>conditional</em> control… Basically a technical discussion. I also added a
link to the video (so that people could make their own opinion). Valeriy
and I had a short exchange, but I noticed that he was deleting some of my
comments (and linkedin leaves no traces when this happens), and he
eventually <strong>deleted all my comments</strong>.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>The deletion of my comments, which were not phrased in an aggressive way,
got me angry, in particular since he was criticizing a work but making
sure that readers could not access the corresponding work to build their
own opinion. Thus I wrote a linkedin post to call out this behind. I
accused him of being “toxic and dishonest”, called for people to unfollow
him. I replied to Valeriy attack on scikit-learn:</p>
<blockquote>
<em>Scikit-learn is free, built by people who are mostly volunteers, or
people payed way below their market value because they care about
making data science accessible and better. Attacks as the one below
are harmful, including because they emotionally harm contributors.
IMHO, they qualify as harassement. Valeriy does this repeatedly. I
commented only this time because it concerned a talk that I had
given.</em></blockquote>
<p>Typically, the correct answer to Internet trolls is to ignore them
because reacting amplifies them. However I decided to speak out because
Valeriy has a lot of followers, more than I have.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>My post received a lot of traction. Many people commented on the post, or
privately, to share that they had experienced similar difficulties with
Valeriy and were happy that someone spoke out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="censoring-via-deletion-of-content-and-regulatory-escalation">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-3">Censoring via deletion of content and regulatory escalation</a></h2>
<p><strong>Cease-and-desist attorney letter</strong> On Sept 23rd 2025, I received a
letter by French attorneys that asked to 1) remove the Linkedin post
within 48 hours 2), publish a post inverting my claims and recognizing
that I was wrong, 3) pay 2000 € within 8 days. The letter was strongly
worded accusing me of libel (“diffamation publique”), citing legal texts,
and threatening me of a lawsuit.</p>
<div class="align-right docutils container">
Do not yield to intimidation letters</div>
<p>The letter was factually incorrectly: it claimed that Valeriy had lost
35k followers because of my message. I would have been very proud of such
success, but it was not true. A closer look at the letter with the help
of an attorney and a para-legal revealed that it could be characterized
as an extortion letter, and I have filled a complain to the Paris bar.</p>
<p>Thus, I ignored the letter.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p><strong>LinkedIn Regulatory Escalation</strong>
A month later, LinkedIn removed my post. Valeriy had filed a complain
with them, and they took down my post without any contradictory hearing.
I mentioned that the analysis of my counsels was that I would win a
lawsuit. They told me to file a lawsuit…</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>So Valeriy managed to erase from Internet my messages trying to reply to
his one-sided view of data-science and derogatory comments on tools that
do not glorify his favorite techniques.</p>
<p>Hence, I am writing this post, to document Valeriy’s behavior. I avoided
doing a long list of evidence of bad behavior, because it is very
unpleasant.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p><strong>Censoring and intimidation, way worse than Internet disagreement</strong></p>
<p class="last">I have no problem accepting disagreement. I understand that people
will say things on Internet that I find unpleasant. But a strategy
that relies on forcing removal of content from Internet create
dishonest conversations. And an actor relying on <strong>intimidation and
extorsion via legal procedures</strong> has no place in scientific or
technical discussions.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-4">Don’t let Valeriy lead smear campaigns</a></h2>
<p>Valeriy will likely strike back, dedicating some of his communication
energy to dismiss projects that I’m involved in.</p>
<p>Such a behavior actual does harm. We, human beings, are affected by
propaganda, whether we are aware of it or not.</p>
<p>Please isolate Valeriy, unfollow him if you are following him, and do not
relay his smear campaigns.</p>
<p>Do not hesitate to spread the present message if he runs smear campaigns
or misbehave.</p>
<p>Do not hesitate to contact me if you want to bring forward more evidence
of Valeriy’s bad behavior, so that we can build solid cases.</p>
