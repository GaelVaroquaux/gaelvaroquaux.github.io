<p class="last">This post discuss the difficulties of communicating while developing
open-source projects and tries to gives some simple advice.</p>
</div>
<p>A large software project is above all a social exercise in which technical
experts try to reach good decisions together, for instance on github
pull requests. But communication is difficult, in particular between
diverging points of view. It is easy to
underestimate how much well-intended persons can misunderstand
each-other and get hurt, in open source as elsewhere. Knowing why
there are communication challenges can help, as well as applying a few
simple rules.</p>

<div class="section" id="open-source-can-be-anxiety-generating-for-the-maintainers">
<h3>Open source can be anxiety-generating for the maintainers</h3>
<p>Maintainers ensure the quality and the long-term life of an open-source
project. As such, <strong>they feel responsible for any shortcoming in
the product</strong>. In addition, they often do this work because they care.
But they can quickly become a converging point of anxiety-generating
feedback:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Code has bugs; the more code, the more bugs. Watching a issue tracker
fill up with a long list of bugs is frightening to people who
feel in charge.</li>
<li>Given that maintainers are visible and qualified, they become the
target of constant requests for attention: from pleas to prioritize a
specific issue to solicitations for advice.</li>
<li>A small fraction of these interactions come as plain
aggressions. I have been insulted many times by unsatisfied
users. Each time, it hurts me a lot. My policy is to
disengage from the conversation, but I am left shaking and staring at
my computer in the evening.</li>

</div>
<p>The more popular a project, the more weight it puts on its maintainers’
shoulders. A consequence is that <strong>maintainers are tired</strong>, and can
sometimes approach discussions in a defensive way. Also, we may be plain
scared of integrating a code that we do not fully comprehend.</p>
<p>Open-source developers may even, unconsciously, adopt a simple, but
unfortunate, protection mechanism: being rude. The logic is flawless: if
I am nasty to people, or I set unreasonnable expectations, people will let me alone.
Alas, this strategy leads to toxic environments. It not only makes people
unhappy but also harms the community dynamics that ground the excellence
of open source.</p>

<h3>The danger abusive gatekeeping</h3>
<!-- add a image of puppy? And a gate? -->
<p>A maintainer quickly learns that every piece of code, no matter how cute
it might be, will give him work in the long run, <a class="reference external" href="https://snarky.ca/setting-expectations-for-open-source-participation/#submittingacontribution">just like a puppy</a>. This
is unavoidable given that the complexity of code grows faster than its number of
features <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a>, and, even for a company as rich as Google,
project maintenance becomes intractable on huge projects <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A maintainer’s job is to say no often</strong>, to protect the project. But,
as any gatekeeping, it can unfurtunately become an excercise in unchecked
power. Making objective choices for these difficult decisions is hard,
and we all tend naturally to trust more people that we know.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>

<p>Most often we are not aware of our shortcomings, let alone are we doing
them on purpose.</p>

<div class="section" id="contributor-s-fatigue">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Contributor’s fatigue</a></h2>
<p>A new contributor starting a conversation with a group of seasoned
project maintainers may easily <strong>feel an imposter</strong>. The
new contributor knows less about the project. In addition, he or she is engaging
with a group of people that know each-other well, and is not yet part of
that <em>inner</em> group.</p>
<p>This person does not know the code base, or the conventions, and must <strong>make
extra efforts</strong>, compared to the seasoned developers, to propose a
contribution suitable for the project. Often, he or she does
not understand fully the reasons for the project guidelines, or for the
feedback given. Request for changes can easily be seen as trifles.</p>
<p>Integrating the contribution can often be a lengthy process –in
particular in scikit-learn. Indeed, it will involve not only shaping up
the contribution, but also learning the skills and discovering the
process. These <strong>long cycles can undermine motivation</strong>: humans need
successes to feel enthusiasm. Also, the contributor may legitimately
worry: Will all these efforts be fruitful? Will the contribution make its
way to the project?</p>
<p>Note that for these reasons, it is recommended to start contributing with
very simple features, and to seek feedback on the scope of the
contribution before writing the code.</p>
<p>Finally, contributors are seldom paid to work on the project, and there
is no single line of command that makes decisions and controls incentives
for all the people on the project. No one is responsible when things go
astray, which means that the weight falls on the shoulder of the
individuals.</p>
<!-- fun pictures, to relax atmosphere, but only later, first write and
review -->
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>The danger behind the lengthy cycle of reviews and improvements needed to
contribute is <strong>death by a thousands cuts</strong>. The contributor looses
motivation, and no longer finds the energy to finish the work.</p>
<div class="grey docutils container">
<p><strong>How about users?</strong></p>
<p>This article is focused on developers. Yet, users are also an
important part of the discussion around open source.</p>
<p>Often communication failures with users are due to frustration.
Frustration of being unable to use the software, of hitting a bug, of
seeing an important issue still not addressed. This frustration stems
from incorrect expectations, which can often be traced to
misunderstanding of the processes and the dynamics. Managing
expectations is important to improve the dialogue, via the
documentation, via notes on the issue tracker.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Communication is hard</a></h2>
<p>Communication is hard: messages are sometimes received differently than
we would like. <strong>Overworked people discussing very technically
challenging issues</strong> only makes the matter worse. I have seen people not
come across well, while I know they are absolutely lovely and caring.</p>
<p>We are human beings; we are limited; we misunderstand things, and we have
feelings.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Emotions</strong> –
My most vivid memory of a communication failure was when I was a sailing
instructor. Trainees that were under my responsibility had put themselves
at risk, causing me a lot of worry. During the debrief, I was angry. My
failure to convey the messages without emotional loading undermined my
leadership on the group, putting everybody at risk for the rest of the
week.</p>
<p>Inability to understand the others’ point of view, or to communicate
ours, can bring in emotions. Emotions most often impedes technical
communication.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Limited attention</strong> –
We, in particular maintainers, are bombarded with email, notifications,
text and code to read.
As a consequence, it is easy to read things too fast, to stop in the
middle, to forget.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Language barriers</strong> –
Most discussions happen in English; but most of us are not native English
speakers. We may hide well our difficulties, but nuances are often lost.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Clique effects</strong> –
Most interactions in open source are done in writing, with low
communication bandwidth. It can be much harder to convince a maintainer
on the other side of the world than a colleague in the same room. Schools
of thoughts naturally emerge when people work a lot together. These
create bubbles, where we have the impression that everything we say is
obvious and uncontroversial, and yet we fail to convince people outside
of our bubble.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Foster multiway discussions</strong> – The goal of a technical discussion is to
come up to the best solution. Better solutions emerge via confronting
different points of view: a single brilliant individual
probably cannot find or recognize the best solution alone.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Integrate input from as many perspectives as possible.</li>
<li>Make sure everyone feels heard.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don’t seek victory</strong> – Most important to keep in mind is that giving
up on an argument and accepting the other point of view is a perfectly
valid option. I naturally biased to think that my view on topics dear to
me is the right one. However, I’ve learned that adopting the view of the
other could bring a lot to the social dynamics of a project: we are often
debating over details and the bigger benefit comes from moving forward.</p>
<p>In addition, if several very bright people have different conclusions
than me about something that they’ve thought a lot, who am I to disagree?</p>

<div class="section" id="convey-ideas-well-pedagogy">
<h3>Convey ideas well: pedagogy</h3>
<p><strong>Explain</strong> – Give the premises of your thoughts. Unroll your thought
promises. People are not sitting in your head, and need to hear not only
your conclusion, but how you got there.</p>
<p><strong>Repeat things</strong> – Account for the fact that people can forget, and
never hesitate to gently restate important points. Reformulating
differently can also help explaining.</p>
<p><strong>Keep it short</strong> – A typical reading speed is around 200 words a
minute. People have limited time and attention span. The greatest help
you can provide to your reader is to condense your ideas: let us avoid
long threads that require several dozens of minutes to read and digest.
There is a tension between this point and the above. My suggestion:
remove every word that is not useful, move details to footnotes or
postscriptums.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Stay technical</strong> – Always try to get to the technical aspect of the
matter, and never the human. Give specific code and wording suggestions.
When explaining a decision, give technical arguments, even if they feel
obvious to you.</p>
<p><strong>Be positive</strong> – Being positive in general helps people feeling happy and
motivated. It is well known that positive feedback leads to quicker
progress than negative, as revealed <em>eg</em> by studies of class rooms. I am
particularly guilty of this: I always forget to say something nice,
although I may be super impressed by a contribution. Likewise, avoid
negative words when giving feedback (stay technical).</p>
<p><strong>Avoid “you”</strong> – The mere use of the pronoun “you” puts the person we are
talking to in the center of message. But the message should not be about
the person, it should be about the work. It’s very easy to react
emotionally when it’s about us. The passive voice can be useful to avoid
putting people as the topic. If the topic is indeed people, sometimes “we”
is an adequate substitute for “you”.</p>
<p><strong>Assume good faith</strong> – There are so many misunderstandings that can
happen. People forget things, people make mistakes, people fail to convey
their messages. Most often, all these failures are in good faith, and
misunderstandings are legitimate. In the rare cases there might possibly
be some bad faith, accounting for it will only make communication worse,
not better. Along the same line, we should ignore when we feel assaulted
or insulted, and avoid replying in kind.</p>
<p><strong>Choose words wisely</strong> – The choice of words matter, because they convey
implicit messages. In particular, avoid terms that carry judgement
values: “good” or “bad”. For example “This is done wrong” (note that this
sentence already avoids “you”), could be replaced by “There might be more
numerically stable / efficient way of doing it” (note also the use of
precise technical wording rather than the generic term “better”).</p>
<p><strong>Use moderating words</strong> – Try to leave room for the other in the
discussion. Statements too assertive close the door to different points
of view: “this must be changed” (note the lack of “you”) should be
avoided while “this should be changed” is better. For this reason, this
article is riddled with words such as “tend”, “often”, “feel”, “may”,
“might”.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t blame someone else</strong> – If you feel that there is some pattern that
you would like to change, do not point fingers, do not blame others.
Rather, point yourself at the center of the story, find an example of
this pattern with you, and the message should be that “it is a pattern
that <em>we</em> should avoid. <em>“We”</em> is such a powerful term. It unites; it
builds a team.</p>
<p><strong>Give your understanding</strong> – If you feel that there is a misunderstanding,
explain how you are feeling. But do it using “I”, and not “you”, and
acknowledge the subjectivity: “I feel ignored” rather than “you are
ignoring me”. Even better: only talk about the feeling: “I am loosing
motivation, because this is not moving forward”, or “I think that am
failing to convey why this numerical problem is such an important issue”
(note the use of “I think”, which avoids casting the situation as
necessarily true).</p>
